# seq_generated_states_convergence
This repository contains the code used to generate the data for plots for the paper "Noise-robust exploration of quantum matter on near-term quantum devices" by Borregaard, Christandl and Fran√ßa. The goal of this code is to test a methodology to check the convergence of sequentially generated states.
The code generates random shallow circuits that define MPS of 50 qubits and a bond dimension that can be defined by the user. 
We refer to the file MPS.py and the paper for more details.
